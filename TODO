* at the end of zoompan filter parameters, set size to the original size of input file using :
  s=(iw/ZOOMMAX/2)x(ih/ZOOMMAX/2)
    => might not work because iw and ih not allowed in size parameters!
* detect dimensions of input file with `file` so we can properly set OUTSIZE before launching the ffmpeg command
